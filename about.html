      <p class="about-bio">
        Daniel started out as an accountant, a great accountant at that, but a normal guy nonetheless.  One day while
        working hard at his accounting firm, he felt a quick, sharp pain on his neck.  Little did he know he was bitten by
        a spider with radioactive spider blood.  Immediately upon realizing what happened, he jumped at the closest wall
        to climb it.  Once he woke up from knocking himself out, he realized the radioactive spider blood didn't give him special
        spider powers, but it left him with an insatiable hunger to program.  That's where his coding journey began, and this is 
        his first of many coding projects to come.

        Dayne comes to us from a planet in a galaxy far, far away, sent to Earth by his parents moments before his home planet's
        destruction.  Dayne safely landed on earth by crashing into the Geocities headquarters.  It was there they raised him, and
        when he was old enough to see their websites, he was disgusted.  On his home planet, they have beautiful, flowing, interactive
        websites that were useful, functional, and very pleasing to the eye.  He could not believe earthlings would stand for such 
        attrocious websites, and it became his life mission to learn Planet Earth's different coding languages, so that he could save us
        all from garbage websites and applications.

        The year is 2029.  Skynet headquarters, despite being the leader in advanced robotics and artificial intelligence, is riddled
        with broken appliances.  Enter Perry Williams, the fearless leader of a team of extraordinary appliance repairmen.
        After accidentally taking a wrong turn into what he thought was the men's room, Perry found himself in the middle om an
        operating table, surrounded by a room full of mad Skynet scientists.  It wasn't long before he was under the knife, being equipped with a NeuralNet Processor,
        a learning computer, capable of learning every programming language known to modern man.  Skynet sent their
        new cyborg, the P800, waaaaaay back in time...10 years to be exact, to the year 2019.

        Johnny was almost killed in a terrible automobile accident many years ago.  In fact, he did die, but was brought back to life
        using cutting-edge technology from some of the world's most renown scientists and surgeons.  They aimed to build him faster,
        stronger, more intellgent, a superhuman the likes of which the world has not yet seen.  They failed.  They did, however,
        give him a great head of hair, and a strong desire to learn programming and web development.
